# Cyber Risk Assessment & Threat Intelligence Platform (Python)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Python-based Cyber Risk Assessment & Threat Intelligence Platform** that automates vulnerability discovery and enriches findings with threat intelligence. The platform is designed to help organizations understand their security posture, prioritize risks, and support compliance with security standards.

The system performs:
- Network discovery and vulnerability scanning  
- Risk-related data enrichment using threat intelligence sources  
- Structured reporting and visualization (in later layers)

This repository currently documents **Layer 1: Discovery & Port Scanning**, which serves as the foundation for subsequent risk analysis and threat intelligence layers.

## Summary

Layer 1 establishes the **discovery and data collection foundation** of the Cyber Risk Assessment & Threat Intelligence Platform. By combining network scanning with vulnerability intelligence and structured data storage, this layer enables:

- Accurate asset visibility  
- Early identification of security weaknesses  
- Reliable input for risk scoring and threat analysis in later layers  

Future layers will build upon this data to deliver risk assessment, threat correlation, alerting, dashboards, and compliance insights.
